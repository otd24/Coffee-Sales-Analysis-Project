# Coffee-Sales-Analysis-Project
This was a project in which our team analyzed coffee shop sales data by ingesting raw data into a normalized database using SQL and Vertabelo.com. We designed and deployed a relational database schema, migrated data, and performed detailed analysis to answer business questions, ensuring data integrity and optimal structure for reporting and querying.
